# DataGovernance

# Chapter 1 

**Data Goverance**
- is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data

**Framework needs three things:**
- A policy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data
- Roles and responsibilities concerning data
- Process detailing what needs to be done to manage data

**What is Governance**
- Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that
  specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.



**Data Governance Versus Data Management**
- Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics,
  and the lifecycle of data


- Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs),
  analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.


**Data Governance versus Information Governance**
- Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy
  and process perspective, despite their differences


-  Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers,
  and other stakeholders.



**Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:**
- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value
- Increased data compliance
- Improved data-driven decision-making
- Enhanced business performance
- Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
- Increased data availability and accessibility
- Improved data search
- Reduced risks from data-related issues
- Reduced data management costs
- Established rules for handling data



**Creating a Data Governance Program**
- Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
- Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
- Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
- Achieving leadership approval.
- Designing and developing the program.
- Implementing the program.
- Monitoring and measuring performance.
- Maintaining the program.


**Data Governance Framework**

**Leadership and Strategy**
- Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization
- For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets?

**Roles and Responsibility**
- Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.

**Policies, Processes, and Standards**
- At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization
- Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed.

**Metrics**
- The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results
- Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding


**Tools**
- These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance

**Communications and Collaboration**
- This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
- Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.



**Maturing the Data Culture**
- Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data

- Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization.

- Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress.

- Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members


**Assessing Data Governance Readiness**

**CheckList for Data Governance Readiness**
- The basis of a data culture exists.
- The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
- Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
- Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole - responsibility of the IT department.
- One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
- The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
- The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
- You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
- Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
- Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
- The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.



# Chapter 2

**Defining Data**
- Data can and is different from every one's perspective

**Categories**

- **Structured:** Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.

- **Unstructured:** Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.

- **Semi-structured:** Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed


**From Data to Insight**

**Data**
- Single or multiple units of something. On their own, largely meaningless.

**Information**
- Data put into context giving it meaning.

**Knowledge**
- Information coupled with experience and practical application. It can be actionable.

**Wisdom**
- Knowledge combined with reasoning and a context to enable relevant application

**Insight**
- Product of either or both knowledge and wisdom that enables us to see things differently


**Diffirences between Data and Information**

**Data**
- Raw
- Items such as characters, words, pictures, and numbers that have no meaning in isolation
- no analysis dependency
- Unorganized and not dependent on context
- Not typically usefull alone

**Information**
- Processed
- Data that is organised and given context to have meaning
- Dependent on the analysis of data
- Organised and dependent on the context
- Useful alone


**The Role of Data in the 21st Century**

In these early decades of the 21st century, we are producing more data than we can handle, and the depth, breadth, and quality of the data that is being used are reshaping not just the tools and capabilities of our industries and cities, but the nature of how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves. 



**Data-Driven Decision-Making**

Deciding on a restaurant based on reviews is an example of data-driven decision-making, but it’s also on the less complex end of the decision-making spectrum.



**Data as The New Oil**
- Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now.


**Data Ownership**
- Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets.
- These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable.



**Data Architecture**
- data architecture is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with Enterprice Architecture and in turn, with the business
- Simply stated, data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.



**The Lifecycle of Data**

1. **Creation:**  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.

2. **Storage:**  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.

3. **Usage:**  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.

4. **Archival:**  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.

5. **Destruction:**  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.



**Defining Big Data**

One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:

**Volume:** The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.

**Variety:** There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. 

**Velocity:** With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed.

**Variability:**  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.

**Veracity:**  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.



# Chapter 3

**Identifying the Roles of Data**


**Operations**
- Business operations concern themselves with a diverse set of activities to run the day-to-day needs and drive the mission of an organization.
- Each business has different needs, and operational functions reflect these specific requirements



**Strategy**
- this is about creating a plan that supports objectives and goals
- understanding the challenges to delivering on the organization’s purpose and the proposed solutions to those challenges



**Decision-Making**
- the highest form of value derived from data is the ability to make better-informed decisions.
- access to abundant data and information has resulted in quicker, timeous, and better-quality business decisions


**Measuring**
- Organizations are in a continuous state of measurement, whether it’s overt or tacit
- Every observed unit of data contributes to building a picture of the business.


**Monitoring**
- This is an ongoing process of collecting and evaluating the performance of, say, a project, process, system, or another item of interest.
- You engage in some manner of monitoring in order to inform whether, in fact, this expectation is being met


**Insight Management**
- Insight management begins with gathering and analyzing data from different sources.
- They must be knowledgeable about what data has value


**Reporting**
-



**Data Analyst**

**Basic steps in data analyst**
- **Data Mining** - identifying and extracting relevant data from data sources
- **Data Cleansing** - sizable effort including removing errors and duplicate data in preparation for analysis
- **Statical analysis** - using statical methods and AI to inetrprt results and devol insights
- **Data presentation**- communicating results using a variety of techniques insluding visualization and data storytelling


**Four Primary types**
- **Descriptive:**  Existing data sets of historical data are accessed, and analysis is performed to determine what the data tells stakeholders about the performance of a key performance indicator (KPI) or other business objectives. It is insight on past performance.

- **Diagnostic:**  As the term suggests, this analysis tries to glean from the data the answer to why something happened. It takes descriptive analysis and looks at the cause.

- **Predictive:**  In this approach, the analyst uses techniques to determine what may occur in the future. It applies tools and techniques to historical data and trends to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes.

- **Prescriptive:**  This analysis focuses on what action should be taken. In combination with predictive analytics, prescriptive techniques provide estimates of the probabilities of a variety of future outcomes.


**Data management**
- is the implementation of data governance. Without data management, data governance is just wishful thinking


**Governing data**
- means that some level of control exists to support a related policy



- **People** -  In governing data, people are the subject matter experts, they are responsible for quality, and they oversee and manage all related processes and responsibilities.

- **Policies:**  A data policy contains a set of adopted rules by an organization that apply to the handling of data in specific conditions and for particular desired outcomes.


- **Metrics:**  It’s largely true, what gets measured gets managed.



# Chapter 4

**Examining the Broader value of Data**

- Data democratization - is the ability of team members to access data they need for their work, without relying on specialists.
- A data silo is data repository controlled by an entity in an organization but not known/shared by other parts of the business.
- data silos reduce collaboration and increase data inconsistencies, also they source of risk including security and regulatory issues.
- data governance helps eliminate data unnecessary data siloes.


**Data catalogs**

**how members can find data**

- method of data discoverability is the creation of an enterprrise data catalog.

e.g store catalog of product details

**3 benefits of data catalogs:**

- Finding data : helps users identify and locate data that is useful.
- Understanding data : answers data questions the purpose and data user
- Making data more useful : creats visibility, describe value and provides access to information.

data catalog cointains data about the data called metadata

**3 types of metadata in a data catalog:**

- Technical metadata : Data about the design of a data set. e.g tables,files names
- Business metadata : organizational data such as business description, assessment of data quality
- Operational metadata : Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it and when was it last backed up.

  
Metadata examples : filenames, file locations, data owners & stewards, data descriptions, dates created & last modified, list of database tabkes and views.

**with data catalog, an organization can :**

- reduce data duplication
- increase operational effeciencies and innovation
- understand data quality
- manage compliance

  
**From Data to Insight**

- actionable data is the most valuable data to an organization.

  
**Data analytics**
- Data analysis is identifying data set. examining it and reporting on findings. its a subset of data analytics
- Data analytics is science that involves collectiong, cleaning, organization, storing and analyzing data
- The source of data for analytics is one or combination of :
 - First-party data : data that an organization collects.
  - Second-party : obtained from another organization
  - Thrird-party : aggregated data obtained from a provider

**Data Monetization**
- data valuation - without a process to place a price on a data set.
- data monetization - is when data provides an economic benefit to an organization
- data valuation is a requirement for data monetization such as selling or licensing data.
- ways to determine data valuation:
  - Cost value method : value is calculated by determining how much it costs to produce,store and replace lost data.
  - Market value approach : value is calculated by researching how comparable data is being priced in open market.
  - Economic value approach : calculated by measuring the impact a data set has on the business bottom line.
  - With-and-without method : claculated by quantifying the impact on cash flow if a data set needs to be replaced.
 
**Data-Driven Descision Making**
- is process of using data to drive business decisions.
- DDDM needs data culture
- Ensuring the right people can use the right data at the right time requires data security and data use policies
- Six-step process to DDDM:
  1. Define the Objectives : relative with orgganizational goals. help scope the work and define metrics.
  2. Identify the data : in addition to using data catalogue, enterprise search this requires engaging with impacted stakeholders. also consult data stewards, data owners
  3. Prepare the data : use deep data science skills to prepare the data for use
  4. Analyze the data : complex analysis and continuous efforts used, include support for ETL architecture. To analyze this data need visualizations.
  5. Determine the findings : once data is displayed in variety of ways, you can ask questions about it.
  6. Take action : Make your decisions.
 
**Developing a Data Strategy for Improved Results**
- *Why does every organization need a data strategy?*
  - The purpose of any type of strategy is to agree on a set of guiding principles that inform decision-making in support of a desired outcome.
  -  In simple terms, it’s the roadmap on how to reach your goals.
  -  - Importance of a Data Strategy: A data strategy provides clarity on how to utilize data as a high-value asset to achieve organizational objectives.
- Purpose of Strategy: A strategy outlines guiding principles for decision-making and resource allocation, ensuring alignment with the organization's vision and mission.
- Risks of Operating Without a Strategy: Without a clear strategy, conflicting goals may arise, leading to inefficiency and chaos.
- Benefits of Having a Strategy: Organizations with a well-defined strategy execute more efficiently, achieve higher profits, and are more successful in reaching their goals.
- Scope of Strategy: A data strategy should encompass all aspects of data management, including usability, accessibility, quality, security, and compliance.
- Tailoring to Organization Size and Complexity: Data strategies should be adapted to the size and complexity of the organization, with variations between small businesses and multinational corporations.
- Actionable Advice: Organizations without a data strategy should create one, while those with existing strategies should ensure they are current and effectively communicated.

Overall, data is a critical asset for businesses and requires deliberate management through a well-defined strategy to realize its full potential for driving organizational success.

## Creating a Data Strategy
- The creation of a data strategy, starting with considerations such as :
  - Data maturity : defined as the degree to which the organization already uses and optimizes data and has experience and skills, quality of the existing data.
  - Industry and size : data prioritization through defense and offense. Defense deals with data security and quality. Offense is using data for insight management and market-facing initiatives.
  - the importance of aligning the strategy with the business goals and ensuring it evolves alongside the changing needs of the organization.
- The five key areas of data requirements :
  - Identify : usable data, clearly defined and described. file name, a file format, and metadata.
  - Store : robust/strong data storage solutions and how it will be shared, accessed, and processed
  - Provision : efficient data sharing processes and reuse data 
  - Process : effective data processing methods e.g data cleansing, standardization, and integration
  - Govern : Institute processes to manage and communicate data policies for data use within the organization. *robust data governance policies.*
 
- The four components of a data strategy :
  - Alignment with the business : the data strategy must support and advance the larger goals of the organization.
  - Identifying roles and responsibilities : outlining the roles of various team members
  - Data architecture : designing data architecture to support scalability and flexibility
  - Data management : implementing comprehensive data management practices to ensure data quality, security, and compliance.
- The significance of data governance in enforcing data rules and maintaining alignment with the data strategy is emphasized, with a reminder that data management and governance processes must be continually updated to remain synchronized with the evolving data strategy.

## Managing and Monitoring your Data Strategy
- The importance of managing and monitoring a data strategy after its implementation. Success hinges on buy-in, a clear roadmap, and effective execution, alongside robust data governance and management functions.
- Recognizing that strategies must evolve, periodic modifications are essential to adapt to changing circumstances and correct errors or gaps.
- Timely strategic corrections demonstrate good leadership.
- Neglecting to review and update the strategy regularly is cautioned against, as it risks relegating the plan to a shelf and missing opportunities for optimization.
- Monitoring involves utilizing appropriate metrics, gathering feedback from stakeholders, and conducting audits to ensure alignment with organizational objectives and agility in response to evolving needs
