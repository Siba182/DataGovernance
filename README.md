# DataGovernance

**Data Goverance**
- is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data

**Framework needs three things:**
- A policy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data
- Roles and responsibilities concerning data
- Process detailing what needs to be done to manage data

**What is Governance**
- Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that
  specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.



**Data Governance Versus Data Management**
- Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics,
  and the lifecycle of data


- Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs),
  analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.


**Data Governance versus Information Governance**
- Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy
  and process perspective, despite their differences


-  Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers,
  and other stakeholders.



**Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:**
- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value
- Increased data compliance
- Improved data-driven decision-making
- Enhanced business performance
- Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
- Increased data availability and accessibility
- Improved data search
- Reduced risks from data-related issues
- Reduced data management costs
- Established rules for handling data



**Creating a Data Governance Program**
- Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
- Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
- Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
- Achieving leadership approval.
- Designing and developing the program.
- Implementing the program.
- Monitoring and measuring performance.
- Maintaining the program.


**Data Governance Framework**

**Leadership and Strategy**
- Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization
- For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets?

**Roles and Responsibility**
- Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.

**Policies, Processes, and Standards**
- At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization
- Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed.

**Metrics**
- The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results
- Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding


**Tools**
- These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance

**Communications and Collaboration**
- This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
- Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.



**Maturing the Data Culture**
- Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data

- Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization.

- Do something, even if itâ€™s small, to show progress.

- Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members
