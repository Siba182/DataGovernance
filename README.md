# DataGovernance

# Chapter 1 

**Data Goverance**
- is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data

**Framework needs three things:**
- A policy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data
- Roles and responsibilities concerning data
- Process detailing what needs to be done to manage data

**What is Governance**
- Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that
  specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.



**Data Governance Versus Data Management**
- Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics,
  and the lifecycle of data


- Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs),
  analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.


**Data Governance versus Information Governance**
- Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy
  and process perspective, despite their differences


-  Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers,
  and other stakeholders.



**Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:**
- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value
- Increased data compliance
- Improved data-driven decision-making
- Enhanced business performance
- Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
- Increased data availability and accessibility
- Improved data search
- Reduced risks from data-related issues
- Reduced data management costs
- Established rules for handling data



**Creating a Data Governance Program**
- Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
- Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
- Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
- Achieving leadership approval.
- Designing and developing the program.
- Implementing the program.
- Monitoring and measuring performance.
- Maintaining the program.


**Data Governance Framework**

**Leadership and Strategy**
- Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization
- For example, how can data governance support the role that data plays in enabling growth in specific markets?

**Roles and Responsibility**
- Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.

**Policies, Processes, and Standards**
- At the heart of every data governance program are the policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization
- Each of these must be designed, developed, and deployed.

**Metrics**
- The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results
- Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding


**Tools**
- These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance

**Communications and Collaboration**
- This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
- Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.



**Maturing the Data Culture**
- Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data

- Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization.

- Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress.

- Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members


**Assessing Data Governance Readiness**

**CheckList for Data Governance Readiness**
- The basis of a data culture exists.
- The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
- Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
- Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole - responsibility of the IT department.
- One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
- The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
- The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
- You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
- Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
- Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
- The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.



# Chapter 2

**Defining Data**
- Data can and is different from every one's perspective

**Categories**

- **Structured:** Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.

- **Unstructured:** Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.

- **Semi-structured:** Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed


**From Data to Insight**

**Data**
- Single or multiple units of something. On their own, largely meaningless.

**Information**
- Data put into context giving it meaning.

**Knowledge**
- Information coupled with experience and practical application. It can be actionable.

**Wisdom**
- Knowledge combined with reasoning and a context to enable relevant application

**Insight**
- Product of either or both knowledge and wisdom that enables us to see things differently


**Diffirences between Data and Information**

**Data**
- Raw
- Items such as characters, words, pictures, and numbers that have no meaning in isolation
- no analysis dependency
- Unorganized and not dependent on context
- Not typically usefull alone

**Information**
- Processed
- Data that is organised and given context to have meaning
- Dependent on the analysis of data
- Organised and dependent on the context
- Useful alone


**The Role of Data in the 21st Century**

In these early decades of the 21st century, we are producing more data than we can handle, and the depth, breadth, and quality of the data that is being used are reshaping not just the tools and capabilities of our industries and cities, but the nature of how we learn, socialize, and entertain ourselves. 



**Data-Driven Decision-Making**

Deciding on a restaurant based on reviews is an example of data-driven decision-making, but it’s also on the less complex end of the decision-making spectrum.



**Data as The New Oil**
- Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now.


**Data Ownership**
- Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets.
- These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable.



**Data Architecture**
- data architecture is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with Enterprice Architecture and in turn, with the business
- Simply stated, data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.



**The Lifecycle of Data**

1. **Creation:**  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.

2. **Storage:**  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.

3. **Usage:**  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.

4. **Archival:**  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.

5. **Destruction:**  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.



**Defining Big Data**

One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:

**Volume:** The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.

**Variety:** There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. 

**Velocity:** With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed.

**Variability:**  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.

**Veracity:**  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.
